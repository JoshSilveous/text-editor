# Description
This was made for an extra credit assignment in one of my college courses. The assignment description was as follows:

Extra Credit (2 points - added on to Final Exam Grade) 
 Create a program in the language you are using for your Final Project, that does the following:
1) Displays some information on the screen
2) Creates a text file on the local hard drive.
3) Adds data to the text file.
4) Save the data to the text file.
5) Close the text file.
6) open the text file and retrieve data from the text file - then display the data on the screen 
7) display the message - File opened successfully on the screen

A PDF must be created with the source code and screen shots of all program activity.


I only uploaded it here for future reference, hence why my commit history isn't very detailed. The final PDF can be found as `CSET4250: Extra Credit II.pdf`
